In theory communism would have put everyone on equal footing, but in practice communism allowed governments to control citizens because the fundamental basics were distorted.

Governments that have used Marxism as a basis for their politics have used their power to treat citizens poorly, controlling them and even killing them when necessary to keep those who opposed the government from rising up against them.

The first communist leader to come into power was Vladimir Lenin, following the 1917 Russian Revolution.

Russia, China, North Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, and Laos are considered to be communist countries.

Communism has failed in practice because the governments have forgotten about the democratic aspect of the ideology which results in the splitting of social classes - which was communism wanted to abolish in the first place.
